1. Why CoqIDE                                   *coqide-introduction*

This plugin is for Coq programming as a counterpart of CoqIDE in Vim.

Besides Coq syntax highlighting, it supports the following features:

- Asynchronous proofs: Vim won't be stuck when validating the proofs.
- Multi-buffer editing: You can edit more than one Coq buffer at the same time
  in a Vim instance.
- Window toggling: You can show or hide |coqide-goal-window| and
  |coqide-message-window|.

==============================================================================
2. Requirements                                 *coqide-requirements*

- vim8 or Neovim.
- vim8/Neovim compiled with Python3 support, you can check by using `echo has('python3')`

==============================================================================
3. Commands                                     *coqide-commands*

:CoqForward                                     *:CoqForward*
    Process the next command. The default binding is <f2> in Normal
    mode.

:CoqBackward                                    *:CoqBackward*
    Go back to the previous state. The default binding is <f3> in Normal
    mode.

:CoqToCursor                                    *:CoqToCursor*
    Process until the command under the cursor if the cursor is ahead of
    the last processed command in the buffer, or go back to the state of
    the sentence under the cursor if the cursor is behind the last processed
    command. The default binding is <f4> in Normal mode and <C-e> in
    Insert mode.

:CoqClearMessage                                *:CoqClearMessage*
    Clear the messages in the |coqide-message-window|.

:CoqNewSession                                  *:CoqNewSession*
    Create a new session on the current buffer. A new coqtop process is
    spawned to process the commands in the buffer.

    A session is created automatically when opening a Coq file, so
    |CoqNewSession| doesn't need to be called manually.

:CoqCloseSession                                *:CoqCloseSession*
    Close the session of the current buffer and kill the related coqtop
    process.

    The session is closed automatically when deleting or hiding a buffer
    (depending on |g:coqide_auto_close_session|), so |:CoqCloseSession| doesn't
    need to be called manually.

:CoqShowGoal                                    *:CoqShowGoal*
    Show |coqide-goal-window|.

:CoqHideGoal                                    *:CoqHideGoal*
    Hide |coqide-goal-window|.

:CoqToggleGoal                                  *:CoqToggleGoal*
    Toggle the visibility of |coqide-goal-window|.

:CoqShowMessage                                 *:CoqShowMessage*
    Show |coqide-message-window|.

:CoqHideMessage                                 *:CoqHideMessage*
    Hide |coqide-message-window|.

:CoqToggleMessage                               *:CoqToggleMessage*
    Toggle the visibility of |coqide-message-window|.

:CoqActivate                                    *:CoqActivate*
    Activate the CoqIDE plugin.

    The CoqIDE plugin is activated automatically when the first Coq file is
    opened, so |:CoqActivate| doesn't need to be called manually.

:CoqDeactivate                                  *:CoqDeactivate*
    Deactivate the CoqIDE plugin, close all the Coq windows and kill all the
    coqtop processes.

    The CoqIDE plugin is deactivated automatically when Vim is quitting, so
    |:CoqDeactivate| doesn't need to be called manually.

4. Windows                                      *coqide-windows*

Goal Window                                     *coqide-goal-window*
    The Goal window shows the goals in the current state. Its content is
    session-based. Hence the content of the window will change when switching
    between the Coq buffers.

Message Window                                  *coqide-message-window*
    The Message window shows the messages generated by the last Coq command.
    Its content is session-based. Hence the content of the window will change
    when switching between the Coq buffers.

==============================================================================
5. Options                                      *coqide-options*

g:coqide_debug                                  *g:coqide_debug*
    Whether to enable the debug logging.

    The default value is 0.

g:coqide_debug_file                             *g:coqide_debug_file*
    The path of the debug logging file relative to the current working
    directory or an absolute path if the path starts with a slash.

    The default value is 'coqide.log'.

g:coqide_auto_close_session                     *g:coqide_auto_close_session*
    When to close the Coq session and kill the coqtop process. The value can
    be 'delete' or 'unload'.

    - 'delete': close the session when the buffer is deleted
    - 'unload': close the session when the buffer is unloaded

    The default value is 'delete'.

    The Vim option |'hidden'| controls the behavior when switching to another
    buffer in a window. If |'hidden'| is off (the default), the buffer is
    unloaded (keeping the buffer name in the buffer list but free the buffer
    content in the memory). If otherwise |'hidden'| is on, the buffer is hidden
    (keeping the buffer name as well as the buffer content).

    Because the default value of |'hidden'| is off, if we close the Coq session
    when unloading the buffer, we cannot resume the session when switching
    back, which is usually not what we want. Hence the default behavior of
    CoqIDE is to close the session only when deleting the buffer (remove
    the buffer name from the buffer list and free the buffer content) instead
    of unloading it.

g:coqide_no_mappings                            *g:coqide_no_mappings*
    Do not set any key mappings.

    The default value is 0.

    The default key mappings are:
    - <f2> to |:CoqForward| in Normal mode
    - <f3> to |:CoqBackward| in Normal mode
    - <f4> to |:CoqToCursor| in Normal mode
    - <C-e> to |:CoqToCursor| in Insert mode

g:coqide_auto_clear_message                     *g:coqide_auto_clear_message*
    Whether to clear the messages in |coqide-message-window| before running a
    command. It can be set to 0 to disable the behavior.

    The default value is 1.

    |:CoqClearMessage| can manually clear the messages.

6. Incomplete Features                          *coqide-incomplete-features*

1. Query.
    No major obstacles. To be added.

2. Auto completion.
    No major obstacles. To be added.

3. Vim 7.4 support.
    The only feature used from Vim8/Neovim is |timer_start|. It could be
    implemented in a Vim7-compatible way.

4. Auto update.
    In CoqIDE (not this plugin), the tip state of the document follows the
    editing actions in the file. However, due to the limitation that Vim has
    no change-reporting feature, a full implementation of this function can be
    tricky.

5. Full state-editing ability.
    In CoqIDE (not this plugin), after fixing the error in a previous
    sentence, some of the following proofs do not need to be validated again.
    However, this ability also depends on the change-reporting feature so as
    to precisely know which sentences are changed and which not.
